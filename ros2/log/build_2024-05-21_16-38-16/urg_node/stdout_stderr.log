[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:28 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findurg_c.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "urg_c", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "urg_c" with any of
  the following names:

    urg_cConfig.cmake
    urg_c-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "urg_c" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "urg_c_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "urg_c"
  provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
  installed.
